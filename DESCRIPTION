Description: Provides functions to fit and visualize forgetting curves using 
 nonlinear least squares (via nlsLM), LOESS smoothing, and generalized 
 additive models (GAM). Supports biexponential, exponential, and log-normal 
 modulated power-law decay forms. Includes tools for grouped and stratified 
 model fitting, critical time estimation, and model comparison using AIC, BIC, 
 and pseudo-RÂ². Offers publication-ready plotting functions for raw, smoothed, 
 and fitted data. Designed for analyzing collective memory and attention decay 
 in cross-sectional, time-series, and survey-based datasets. The package is 
 grounded in recent research on collective memory dynamics. If you use this
