## Overview

This vignette demonstrates how to analyze noisy memory data collected from surveys using the `MemoryDecay` package. The pipeline includes data cleaning, smoothing using LOESS, fitting a biexponential forgetting curve, and producing high-quality visualizations.

---

## 1. Load Required Package and Example Data

```r
library(MemoryDecay)

# Load example dataset on recall of historical figures
data("survey_data")
```

---

## 2. Clean and Filter the Survey Data

We remove low-response entities and prepare the dataset for age-based modeling.

```r
survey_data_proc <- process_data(
  data = survey_data,
  id_col = "entity_id",
  age_var = "age_metric",
  group_var = "location_flag",
  replies_col = "reply_count",
  quantile = 1,      # No stratification
  percentile = 0,    # No outlier removal
  filter_n = 1       # Keep all entries with at least 1 reply
)
```

---

## 3. Smooth the Age-Attention Relationship

We apply LOESS smoothing to reduce noise across age bins for each location.

```r
time_filter_survey_data <- smooth_survey_decay(
  survey_data_proc,
  age_var = "age_metric",
  response_var = "performance_score",
  group_var = "location_flag",
  filter_age = 150
)
```

---

## 4. Visualize Raw vs. Smoothed Data

This step helps you see how LOESS smoothing improves the interpretability of patterns in memory decay.

```r
plot_raw_memory_decay(
  raw_df = survey_data_proc,
  aggregated_df = time_filter_survey_data,
  age_var = "age_metric",
  response_var_raw = "performance_score",
  response_var_agg = "loess_correct",
  group_var = "location_flag",
  log_y = FALSE,
  xlim_vals = c(30, 150),
  ylim_vals = c(0.3, 0.75)
)
```

---

## 5. Fit Biexponential Forgetting Models

We now fit separate forgetting curves per location using smoothed data.

```r
fitted_df <- fit_biexponential_model(
  time_filter_survey_data,
  age_var = "age_metric",
  observed_col = "loess_correct",
  group_var = "location_flag",
  N_ref = 1,
  weight_early_points = TRUE
)
```

---

## 6. Plot the Fitted Curves

Finally, we generate a polished figure comparing observed and modeled attention across locations.

```r
plot_fitted_decay_for_publication(
  fitted_df,
  observed_col = "loess_correct",
  fitted_col = "fitted_correct",
  age_var = "age_metric",
  group_var = "location_flag",
  export_path = "./Figures/trivia"
)
```

## Conclusion

This vignette illustrates how `MemoryDecay` can process and model collective recall data, highlighting group-level dynamics in forgetting. This workflow is particularly useful for social science studies on cultural memory, fame, and knowledge diffusion.
