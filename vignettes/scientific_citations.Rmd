## Overview

This vignette demonstrates how to model forgetting curves using the `MemoryDecay` package. We analyze a dataset of scientific citation time series, grouped by cumulative attention levels.

The tutorial walks through:

1. Reshaping raw time series data
2. Computing cumulative attention (e.g., total citations)
3. Binning documents by cumulative attention
4. Aggregating and smoothing age-response curves
5. Fitting a biexponential forgetting model
6. Visualizing group-level decay patterns

---

## 1. Load Required Packages and Data

```r
library(MemoryDecay)

# Load citation time series data
data("time_series_data")
```

---

## 2. Reshape Data to Wide Format

Each column represents a DOI (document), and each row corresponds to a year.

```r
wide_df <- reshape_citation_timeseries(time_series_data)
```

---

## 3. Compute Cumulative Citations

This helps define how much total attention each document has received.

```r
cumulative_df <- compute_cumulative_matrix(wide_df)
```

---

## 4. Define and Assign Bins Based on Attention

We use custom breakpoints to create bins (e.g., top-cited, mid-cited, etc.).

```r
breaks <- c(0, 1.1, 3.3, 11, 36, 60, Inf)
bin_df <- assign_decay_bins(cumulative_df, breaks = breaks)
```

---

## 5. Merge Bins with Original Data and Compute Age

We align bin labels with the raw data and create an age variable since 1980.

```r
final_df <- merge_bins_with_original(wide_df, bin_df)
final_df$age <- final_df$time - 1980
```

---

## 6. Aggregate Mean Attention by Age and Bin

This prepares the data for modeling decay over time.

```r
temporal_data_agg <- aggregate_mean_response(
  final_df,
  age_var = "age",
  response_var = "value",
  group_var = "decay_bin"
)
```

---

## 7. Fit Biexponential Forgetting Curves

We fit a biexponential decay model to each group using the aggregated data.

```r
fitted_df <- fit_biexponential_model(
  temporal_data_agg,
  age_var = "age_metric",
  observed_col = "mean_response",
  group_var = "decay_bin",
  weight_early_points = TRUE
)
```

---

## 8. Plot the Fitted Curves

This produces a publication-ready figure showing the decay pattern per group.

```r
plot_fitted_decay_for_publication(
  fitted_df,
  observed_col = "mean_response",
  fitted_col = "fitted_correct",
  age_var = "age_metric",
  group_var = "decay_bin",
  log_y = TRUE
)
```

---

## Conclusion

This workflow highlights how to preprocess citation data, group documents by cumulative impact, and estimate forgetting curves using the `MemoryDecay` package. This type of analysis is useful for studying long-term attention dynamics in science and knowledge diffusion.
