## Overview

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `MemoryDecay` package to fit and compare forgetting curves on cross-sectional data. The example uses the built-in dataset `cross_section_data`, which contains popularity values (e.g., Google Trends or citation counts) for individuals or entities over time.

We will:

1. Aggregate the data by age.
2. Fit a biexponential memory decay model.
3. Compare it with exponential and log-normal alternatives.
4. Visualize all fitted models.

---

## 1. Load Libraries and Data

```r
library(MemoryDecay)
library(dplyr)

# Explore data
head(cross_section_data)
```

---

## 2. Aggregate by Age

We compute the mean popularity per age to smooth out individual-level variation.

```r
cross_section_data_agg <- cross_section_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(CurrentPopularity = mean(CurrentPopularity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

---

## 3. Fit Biexponential Model

We fit the default biexponential decay model to the aggregated data, emphasizing early points (useful for capturing fast initial decay).

```r
fitted_df <- fit_biexponential_model(
  data = cross_section_data_agg,
  age_var = "age",
  observed_col = "CurrentPopularity",
  weight_early_points = TRUE
)
```

---

## 4. Plot the Fitted Curve

Visualize the model fit against the original data.

```r
plot_fitted_decay(
  fitted_df,
  observed_col = "CurrentPopularity",
  fitted_col = "fitted_correct",
  age_var = "age",
  log_x = FALSE
)
```

---

## 5. Fit and Compare All Models

We now fit all three models—biexponential, exponential, and log-normal—and compare their performance using AIC/BIC.

```r
all_models <- fit_all_models_log(
  data = cross_section_data_agg,
  age_var = "age",
  observed_col = "CurrentPopularity",
  weight_early_points = TRUE
)

all_models$model_comparison
```

---

## 6. Plot All Models Together

```r
plot_all_models(
  all_models,
  age_var = "age",
  observed_col = "CurrentPopularity",
  log_y = TRUE
)
```

---

## Conclusion

This example illustrates a basic workflow using `MemoryDecay` with cross-sectional data. The tools provided allow for quick comparisons of multiple forgetting models and produce high-quality visualizations for publications or reports.
