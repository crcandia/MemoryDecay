\title{Anonymized Citation Time Series from a Scientific Journal (1980–2003)}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{doi}}{An anonymized identifier for the cited paper.}
  \item{\code{N_cit_Infla}}{Inflation-adjusted number of citations received during the semester.}
  \item{\code{time}}{Publication time window, expressed in semiannual steps (e.g., 1984.0, 1984.5).}
}
}
\usage{
data(time_series_data)

\description{
\code{time_series_data} is an anonymized time series dataset containing citation activity 
for scientific papers published in a major (anonymized) journal, observed at a semiannual frequency 
between 1980 and 2003. It captures how many citations each paper received over time, with inflation 
adjustments that correct for changing publication volume.
}
\details{
Each row represents the number of citations received by a single paper in a specific semester.
The dataset allows tracking of longitudinal citation dynamics at the individual paper level, 
and is designed for modeling memory decay, preferential attachment, or inflation-normalized impact.

The variable \code{N_cit_Infla} refers to the number of citations received by the paper in that time window, 
adjusted by an inflation factor derived from the total number of publications in the journal. 
The time variable is numeric and increases in 0.5-year increments (i.e., Jan–Jun = ".0", Jul–Dec = ".5").

All identifiers (e.g., DOIs, journal IDs) have been anonymized. The dataset was constructed 
using SQL queries over a MonetDB instance connected to a large-scale citation graph from the APS corpus.

This dataset contains \strong{3 columns} and \emph{n} rows (observations by paper-semester).
