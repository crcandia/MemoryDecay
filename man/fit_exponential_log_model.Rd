\description{
Fits a log-transformed exponential decay model to collective memory or attention data.
The model assumes attention decays continuously over time without a peak.

\section{Exponential Decay Model}{


The model is expressed in log-transformed form as:
\deqn{
\log S(t) = \log c - q \cdot t
}
which is equivalent to:
\deqn{
S(t) = c \cdot e^{-qt}
}

where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{S(t)} is the observed popularity or recall at time \eqn{t},
  \item \eqn{c} is the initial attention (scaling factor),
  \item \eqn{q} is the exponential decay rate.
}

Fitting in log-space has several advantages:
\itemize{
  \item It linearizes the decay process for stable nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation.
  \item Reduces the influence of high-value outliers.
  \item Emphasizes early decay, typical in forgetting processes.
  \item Improves variance stability in heteroscedastic data.
}

This model assumes **monotonic decay**, and may not be appropriate if the data exhibit
a peak or burst pattern followed by decline.
