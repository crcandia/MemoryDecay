\title{MemoryDecay: Fitting Collective Memory Decay Curves}
\description{
Provides functions to fit and visualize forgetting curves using nonlinear least squares (via nlsLM), LOESS smoothing, and generalized additive models (GAM). Supports biexponential, exponential, and log-normal modulated power-law decay forms. Includes tools for grouped and stratified model fitting, critical time estimation, and model comparison using AIC, BIC, and pseudo-RÂ². Offers publication-ready plotting functions for raw, smoothed, and fitted data. Designed for analyzing collective memory and attention decay in cross-sectional, time-series, and survey-based datasets. The package is grounded in recent research on collective memory dynamics.
